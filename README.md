# Convolution-Deep-Neural-Network-with-Sparse-Autoencoder-and-Reinforcement-Learning
Under development Autoencoder tested now, Sparse Greedy Denoiseing tested. Just a place to store my code under develop the code until finish.
When finish it will be placed here.

Dependency:

OpenCV (Not use the computation on GPU yet, to be continued later) QT need for the push buttoms GUI

Compile:

`$ make`

Run:

`$ ./OW_CNN_R`


Input image is eather from input.JPG or CIFAR-10 depending on Y/N start question. 
CIFAR-10 data set as image input testing. 
To do that download "CIFAR-10 binary version (suitable for C programs)" dataset from
https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
Extract and put data_batch_1.bin in same place as the program. 

TODO:
Add Batch Normalization after each layer
